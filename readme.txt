What is wxTasks ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wxTasks is a task list/process killer modelled after the WarpCenter 
Click on the icon and you will get a list of running tasks, click on a 
task to show it. 
Or, click on the icon with Ctrl pressed and you will get a list of 
running processes, click on a process and you will be asked to confirm 
to kill it.

wxTasks is tested on eComStation but should work on Warp 4 or Warp Server 
for eBusiness.

Its beta quality but it does work. It switches to tasks and kills 
processes as good (or as bad) as WarpCenter.

The sourcecode is included in the src subdirectory. Please note that its 
partly based on xCenter/xWorkPlace code and that its GPL.

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Place wxTask.dll in your XWORKPLACE\plugins\xcenter directory and install
it using the xCenter menus.
